Greets to the committee from the chairdwarf of The Committee on Dwarven Affairs!

I hope this parchment finds you well. We will be exchanging this document to convey important information to whoever happens to be the Fort Supervisor. Please do read and amend this document as you see fit.

~~~ Year 59 ~~~

	1st of Granite:
It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the defeat of our kingdom to the goblins who call themselves the Hoary Scorpion. Only 59 years since its founding, our capital, Scalybridged has been conquered, and a slimy goblin by the name of Em Blottick now sits on OUR throne.

On behalf of our queen in exile, Ral "Diedglaze" Rashfikod, I have taken it upon myself to form The Committee on Dwarven Affairs to organize the construction of a fortress from which we can organize the liberation of our kingdom. I am confident that where one dwarf might fail, a committee will always succeed!

Signed,
- Chairdwarf Chris McFancypants

	15th of Granite:
We arrived at the site of our new fortress across the Waters of Strife in the Crazy Prairies. Sure, this sea-side savannah might be hot and dry, but think of the wonderful view of the ocean when the sun sets!
