Greets to the committee from the chairdwarf of The Committee on Dwarven Affairs!

I hope this parchment finds you well. We will be exchanging this document to convey important information to whoever happens to be the Fort Supervisor. Please do read and amend this document as you see fit.

~~~ Year 59 ~~~

	1st of Granite:
It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the defeat of our kingdom to the goblins who call themselves the Hoary Scorpion. Only 59 years since its founding, our capital, Scalybridged has been conquered, and a slimy goblin by the name of Em Blottick now sits on OUR throne.

On behalf of our queen in exile, Ral "Diedglaze" Rashfikod, I have taken it upon myself to form The Committee on Dwarven Affairs to organize the construction of a fortress from which we can organize the liberation of our kingdom. I am confident that where one dwarf might fail, a committee will always succeed!

Signed,
- Chairdwarf Chris McFancypants

	15th of Granite:
We arrived at the site of our new fortress across the Waters of Strife in the Crazy Prairies. Sure, this sea-side savannah might be hot and dry, but think of the wonderful view of the ocean when the sun sets!

A trade caravan has arrived from the Mountain Home! Kumil Gatizkubuk is our trade liason

More refugees from the Mountain Home. Just in time to help with the first aquifer drop!

We knocked out the supports for the first ring of the aquifer penetration project and... discovered that there is still a bit of dirt stopping the ring from falling.

	8th of Sandstone
And down it goes!!! Though I'll admit that the drop caught os by surprise. We were in the process of removing another bit of dirt that we thought wsa also in the way when the ring gave way. Poor Datan Sanusid and Chief Medical Dwarf Cerol Olinzokun fell in with the ring. Cerol survived. Datan drowned.

Oh look! My shift is up. I'll leave it to the next Fort Supervisor to rescue our Chief Medial Dwarf and recover Datan's body for burial. Good luck, my friend!
